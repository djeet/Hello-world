                </div>
                <p>If there's one thing Venuemob likes, it's beer. We like plenty of other things sure, but if we had to list all the things we like â€¦ we're pretty sure beer would be near the top of said list. Why? Beer is tasty. It's tasty in the sunshine, it's tasty at night, in the heat, and in the cold. Lounging around in the sun, or snug by the fire as it rains outside, with dinner or after dinner, during the week or as the weekend rolls around.</p>

                <p>Put it this way: we wouldn't say we don't like beer.</p>

                <p>Needless to say, the Venuemob team's pretty darn excited about the imminent Good Beer Week, happening all around Melbourne in the coming weeks. Looking through the program is an exercise in attempting not to drool all over one's keyboard. Let's be honest, this blog post is basically just an excuse to peruse the events while at work.</p>

                <p>The Venuemob office â€“ like so many other offices or friendship circles â€“ is made up of varying degrees of beer-lovers. There are the resident beer geeks and aficionados, the kind that will hunt down the new brews on the scene, and who describe each new sip with the verbose aplomb of the wine-lover. On the other end of the spectrum, there's the beer lover who simply loves beer. No comments on the subtle differences in flavour, no devotion to a certain brewery, just a supreme fondness for the nectar of the gods.</p>

                <p>Frankly it doesn't matter (IMHO) what camp one falls under, as long as we can enjoy a brew together in the sun, or rugged up against the cold. Which â€“ you can see where this is going, right? â€“ is where Good Beer Week comes into play. Wherever you happen to fall within the spectrum of "beer noob" and "beer geek", chances are there are at least a few causes for excitement throughout the event. After a bit of initial excitement, gleeful hand-clapping and aforementioned salivation, here are a few of Venuemob's picks.</p>

                <div class="para-heading">Beer vs Pig V: The Kiwis</div>

                <p>Beer and pork? We're in. There was almost no reason to read the actual event description, such is our love for beer and pig-related food products. This one's at Atticus Finch on Lygon Street (East Brunswick), and stars a dozen beers and a dozen cured pigs and probably quite a bit of beer nerdery. Do we need to go on?</p>

                <div class="para-heading">East vs West: Beer and Food Title Fight</div>

                <p>Alright, so technically this one's sold out â€“ but that doesn't mean we can't cross our fingers and hope someone will magically appear out of nowhere with some tickets (hint hint, universe). It's basically an all-out battle between Melbourne and Perth, two cities who consider themselves the beer capital of our fair country. Six rounds of beers teamed with tasty, tasty food â€“ all fed to the discerning group of guests, who then cast their votes. At the end, a winning city is crowned, and everyone rolls back home in a food coma. Which sounds amazing.</p>
